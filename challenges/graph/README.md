## Graph


## code challenge 35



### challenge


- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:


- ``` addNode() ```

- Adds a new node to the graph
- Takes in the value of that node
- Returns the added node


- ``` addEdge() ```

- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- Include the ability to have a “weight”
- Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
- Both nodes should already be in the Graph


- ``` getNodes() ```

- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection set, list, or similar.


- ``` getNeighbors() ```

- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Takes in a given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection


- ``` size() ```

- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
